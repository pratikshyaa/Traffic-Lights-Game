# Traffic-Lights-Game
This Traffic Lights game is a 3 * 4 version of the game originally invented by Alan Parr. I used C# and Unity to build this. 
Each square of a 3-by-4 grid is considered to be a light that is currently off.  Players alternate selecting a square that does not show a red light.

If the selected square's light is off, it becomes a green light.
If the selected square's light is green, it turns into yellow.
If the selected square's light is yellow, it becomes red and can no longer be selected.
The first player that makes three lights on in a row/column/diagonal of the same green/yellow/red color wins.
